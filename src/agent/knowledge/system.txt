1. Slow System Performance:
   - Description: System runs slower than usual, affecting application response times.
   - Common Causes: Low memory availability, high CPU usage, too many startup applications, malware infections.
   - Resolution Steps:
     - Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager and check CPU/memory usage.
     - Close unnecessary applications and background processes.
     - Run a malware scan using Windows Defender or approved antivirus software.
     - Clear temporary files using Disk Cleanup (cleanmgr).
     - Restart the system.
   - Escalation: Escalate if performance issues persist after cleanup and resource optimization.

2. Frequent System Crashes:
   - Description: System unexpectedly shuts down or restarts.
   - Common Causes: Faulty hardware drivers, overheating, corrupted system files, hardware failure.
   - Resolution Steps:
     - Update all device drivers via Device Manager.
     - Check system temperature using built-in BIOS/UEFI tools or third-party apps.
     - Run `sfc /scannow` in Command Prompt (Admin).
     - Ensure proper ventilation and remove dust from hardware components.
     - Restart and monitor stability.
   - Escalation: Escalate to hardware support if crashes persist or BSOD codes indicate hardware failure.

3. System Restart Loop:
   - Description: Computer repeatedly restarts without reaching the desktop.
   - Common Causes: Boot configuration corruption, Windows update failure, faulty hardware.
   - Resolution Steps:
     - Boot into Safe Mode (F8 or Shift + Restart).
     - Uninstall recent updates via Control Panel → Programs → View installed updates.
     - Run Startup Repair from Windows Recovery Environment.
     - Check boot order in BIOS/UEFI.
   - Escalation: Escalate if startup repair fails or hardware diagnostics detect a fault.

4. Application Not Responding:
   - Description: An application becomes unresponsive during use.
   - Common Causes: Software bugs, insufficient memory, compatibility issues.
   - Resolution Steps:
     - Open Task Manager, select the application, and click “End Task.”
     - Restart the application.
     - Update the application to the latest version.
     - Check for OS updates.
   - Escalation: Escalate to software vendor support if crashes happen consistently.

5. Blue Screen of Death (BSOD):
   - Description: Windows displays a blue error screen with a stop code.
   - Common Causes: Faulty drivers, hardware issues, corrupted system files.
   - Resolution Steps:
     - Note the stop code for troubleshooting.
     - Update or roll back drivers.
     - Run memory diagnostics (mdsched.exe).
     - Run `chkdsk /f` to scan disk for errors.
   - Escalation: Escalate to IT hardware team if hardware diagnostics indicate failure.
